This package provides functional shims for ECMAScript.

It is targeted at providing function shims for ECMAScript 6 and beyond targeted at ECMAScript 5.  It is different
other solutions of shimming or polyfilling functionality, in that it does not provide the functionality via
augmenting the built in classes in the global namespace.

The one exception to this though is the `Symbol` functionality, in that the well-known symbols need to be located
off of the global `Symbol` object in order to ensure that the correct symbol is referenced.

**WARNING** This is *beta* software.  While we do not anticipate significant changes to the API at this stage, we may feel the need to do so.  This is not yet production ready, so you should use at your own risk.
